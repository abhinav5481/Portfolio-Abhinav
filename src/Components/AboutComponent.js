            Hello! I'm Abhinav, a 22 year old, self-taught full stack developer.<br/>
I graduated from National Institute of Technology, Raipur in 2020, majoring in Electrical Engineering. Despite being 
from a non-computer science background, I got into coding/development because computers have always fascinated me.
 Seeing code getting converted to things we use regularly, like Facebook or Amazon, was no less than magic to me and that's where my quest to invent began!.
 As a personal mission, I strive to empower and improve otherâ€™s outlook and circumstances. 
I believe in being genuine and nurturing. My abilities extend to critical thinking and problem-solving with proficiency in decision-making. 
 I am always interested in learning, growing, and contributing to awesome projects!
 <br />
 <br />
 When not in front of a computer, you will probably find me playing guitar, relishing music ðŸŽµðŸŽ§.
